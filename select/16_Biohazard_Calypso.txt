You're so cute
I wanna strangle you
Straight out of the lab
My little biohazard

My love, my everything
I don't know what it is that you're radiating
That's got me so absorbed
You're an amalgamation of what I adore
Tell me, tell me it all
How the hell you got me so enthralled?
Now come on, you creepy crawler
Give me some of what you have to offer

And if it wasn't me, saying all of this
I can promise you I'd be pretty sick
Your venom's in my veins and it's running through my heart
Back from the dead running to my arms

You're so cute
I wanna strangle you
Straight out of the lab
My littlе biohazard
A rotten core
You know I love you morе
An atomic blast
My little biohazard

We're safe for now
But not for long
This experiment has gone all wrong
The needle's reading off the chart
What's that sound?
Oh, it's just my heart
Atomically unstable, maybe
I should cut the, cut the cable

And if it wasn't me, saying all of this
I can promise you I'd be pretty sick
Your venom's in my veins and it's running through my heart
Back from the dead running to my arms

You're so cute
I wanna strangle you
Straight out of the lab
My little biohazard
A rotten core
You know I love you more
An atomic blast
My little biohazard

(My little biohazard)
I've come down with some strange illness
Butterflies bringing life to this soulless
Empty pit for the hell of it
My little biohazard

You're so cute (Oh, you're so cute)
I wanna strangle you (I wanna strangle you)
Straight out of the lab (Straight out of the lab)
My little biohazard
A rotten core (Poison to my core)
You know I love you more ('Cause I love you more)
An atomic blast
My little biohazard
