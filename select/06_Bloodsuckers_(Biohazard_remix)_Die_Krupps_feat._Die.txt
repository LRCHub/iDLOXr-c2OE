Die Krupps
Die Krupps II: The Final Option
Bloodsuckers
Bloodsuckers
You suck out the oil
For the salt of the earth
You ravage the soil

Strip mining mountains
You gauge out the face
You suffocate life
In an asphalt membrane

Don't eat your own heart
'Cause you can never win

Bloodsuckers
You steel from the earth
You'll kill for the riches
And decide what it's worth

Bloodsuckers
Got your values out of whack
You've been selling your soul
For a greenback stack
